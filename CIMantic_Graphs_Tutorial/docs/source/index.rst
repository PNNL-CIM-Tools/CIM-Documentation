.. image:: CIM_Graph_Logo.png

Python library for creating in-memory labeled property graphs for creating, parsing, and editing CIM power system models. It creates Python object instances in memory using a data profile exported from a specified CIM profile (e.g. IEC61970cim18v01 or GridAPPS-D CIM100 RC4_2021).

The library is being expanded to cover centralized applications, transmission models, and real-time editing of CIM XML models natively.
